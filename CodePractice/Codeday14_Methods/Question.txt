Write a Java program to check whether a number is a Harshad Number or not.
In recreational mathematics, a harshad number in a given number base, is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base.
Example: Number 200 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 2 and 0 and 0 is 2(2+0+0) and 200 is divisible by 2. Number 171 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 1 and 7 and 1 is 9(1+7+1) and 171 is divisible by 9.
Create a Class HarsadNumber (BLC)
methods:

Method name: getSum()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: int
Logic: This methods returns the sum of each digit.

Method name: checkHarsad()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: void
Logic: This checks and prints the number is harsad number or not a harsad number.

Create a ELC class named TestHarsadNumber, take main method and test the code by taking the input from user.
Expected Output

Input a number : 353

353 is not a Harshad Number.

Write a Java program to check if a number is a cube or not.
In arithmetic and algebra, the cube of a number n is its third power: the result of the number multiplied by itself twice:
n3 = n × n × n.
Create a class CheckCube(BLC):
Method name: getNum()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: int
Logic: This methods checks the given parameter is a cube of any number or not, if yes then it returns the num, if the number is not a cube of any number then it returns 0.

Method name: checkCube()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: void
Logic: This method calls the getNum() to find out the given number is a cube of any number or not, if the getNum() returns other than 0 then print the ____ Number is a cube of ____ else print "There is no cube of ______"

Create a ELC class named TestCube, take main method and test the code by taking the input from user.

Input Data:
Input a number: 8
Expected Output

Number is a cube of 2.

Write a program to check if a number is a Mersenne number or not.
In mathematics, a Mersenne number is a number that can be written in the form M(n) = 2n − 1 for some integer n.
The first four Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, and 127
Crea a class MersenneNumber(BLC)
Method name: checkMersenne()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: void
Logic: Check the number is a Mersenne number or not by following above explanation. If yes then print the number is Mersenne number,
else print Number is not Mersenne Number

Create a ELC class named TestMersenneNumber, take main method and test the code by taking the input from user.

Expected Output

Input a number: 127
127 is a Mersenne number

Write a Java program to create the first twenty Hamming numbers.
In computer science, regular numbers are often called Hamming numbers, Hamming Numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 and 5.
The first few hamming numbers are :
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32
Create a class HammingNumber

Method name: isPrime()
Parameter: int
Modifiers: public, static
return type: boolean
Logic: This method return boolean value based on number is prime or not.

Method name: q                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            aw()
Parameter: -
Modifiers: public, static
return type: void
Logic: This method finds the factorials and checks the factorials are prime or not by calling isPrime(), then if the only prime factors are 2,3,5 then Prints first 20 hamming Numbers.

Create a ELC class named TesthammingNumber, take main method and test the code.


Expected Output
First Twenty Hamming numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 16 18 20 24 25 27 30 32 36
