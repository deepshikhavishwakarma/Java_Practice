8.What is the difference between static and instance variables in Java?
a) Static variables are associated with the class itself, while instance
variables are associated with an instance of a class.
b) Static variables are shared among all instances of a class,
while instance variables have separate values for each instance.
c) Static variables can be accessed without creating an object,
while instance variables require an object reference.
